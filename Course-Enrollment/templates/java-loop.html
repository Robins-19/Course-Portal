  <h1>Loop Control</h1>
  <p>
    There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
    <br>
    Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
    <br>
    A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Types of loop</h1>
  <p>Java programming language provides the following types of loop to handle looping requirements.</p>
  <h3>1. while loop</h3>
  <p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.
    <br>
    <b>Syntax</b>
    <br>
    while(Boolean_expression) {
<br>// Statements
<br>}
  </p>
  <h3>
    2. for loop</h3>
  <p>
    Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
    <br>
    <b>Syntax</b>
    <br>
    for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update) {
<br>// Statements
<br>}
  </p>
  <h3>3. do...while loop</h3>
  <p>Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.
    <br>
    <b>Syntax</b> <br>
    do {
<br>// Statements
<br>}while(Boolean_expression);

  </p>


  <br>
  <h1>Loop Control Statements</h1>
  <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
<br>
Java supports the following control statements.<br>
<b>break statement: </b>Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
<br>
<b>continue statement: </b>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.




  </p>


<h1>Enhanced for loop in Java</h1>
<p>
  As of Java 5, the enhanced for loop was introduced. This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.
<br>
Syntax
<br>
Following is the syntax of enhanced for loop âˆ’
<br>
for(declaration : expression) {
<br>// Statements
<br>}
</p>
